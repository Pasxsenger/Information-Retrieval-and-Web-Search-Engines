To learn more about the benefits of AWS Certification, go here.\n\nHow do I register to take an AWS Certification exam?\n\nTo register for an exam, sign in to aws.training and click Certification in the top navigation. Next, click the AWS Certification Account button, followed by Schedule New Exam. Find the exam you wish to take and click the Schedule at Pearson VUE button. You will then be redirected to the test delivery provider’s scheduling page, where you will complete your exam registration.\n\nWhat is the retake policy?\n\nIf you fail an exam, you must wait 14 calendar days before you are eligible to retake the exam. There is no limit on exam attempts. However, you must pay the full registration fee for each exam attempt. Once you have passed an exam, you will not be able to retake the same exam for two years. If the exam has been updated with a new exam guide and exam series code, you will be eligible to take the new exam version.\n\nNote that beta exam test takers can take the beta version only once, after which they will need to wait to retake the exam when the official certification exam becomes generally available.\n\n\nWill I see my preliminary exam results, pass/fail, on the screen upon completing my test?\n\nMost AWS Certification exams do not display your pass/fail result at the end of the test. Your detailed exam results will be available within five business days of completing your exam in your AWS Certification Account, under Exam History. If you pass your exam, you may receive your Credly digital badge email notification before your exam results are posted to your AWS Certification Account. Credly is our approved digital badge provider.\n\nOnly the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam will display your pass/fail result at the end of the test.\n\nWhen will I get my exam results?\n\nYour detailed exam results will be available within five business days of completing your exam in your AWS Certification Account, under Exam History.\n\nBeta exam results are typically available 90 days (13 weeks) or less from the close of the beta exam. You will be notified via email once your exam results are available in your AWS Certification Account.\n\n\nIs there an option to reschedule my exam if I cannot make my scheduled appointment?\n\nYes. You can cancel or reschedule your exam up to 24 hours before your scheduled appointment without additional fees. To reschedule or cancel your exam, go to your AWS Certification Account and click the Manage Pearson VUE exams button. Select the scheduled exam you wish to manage from the Upcoming Appointments menu. Once you reach the 24-hour window before your scheduled appointment, you will not be able to cancel or reschedule your exam. If you miss your scheduled exam appointment, you will forfeit the exam fee and are not eligible for a refund (see medical exception below). You will not be able to register again for the exam until 24 hours after your missed exam time. Missing the exam does not result in a “fail” status.\n\nTo receive support for a cancellation or a missed exam, due to a medical emergency contact your test vendor: Pearson VUE.\n\nFor personal illness (with medical documentation) or for unforeseen emergency situations (documentation required), the test delivery vendors will waive the fee and allow a reschedule without fees. In emergency situations, you will be required to provide official documentation of the emergency event. This policy is noted and digitally agreed to in the test registration agreement and in the exam appointment confirmation email. Pearson VUE staff will respond to your ticket within a period of 5 business days (weekends and holidays are not included). Note: If you do not receive a response from the vendor after 5 business days, please reply to this email with their ticket number for further assistance.\n\nPlease note that you may only reschedule two times after scheduling your original appointment. If you wish to reschedule a third time, you must cancel and schedule a new appointment. The reschedule limit will apply to the new appointment. Exam appointments cannot be cancelled less than 24 hours prior to your appointment.\n\nHow can I verify an individual's certification status?\n\nTo verify an AWS Certification, ask the earner for an AWS Certification digital badge link. Via Credly’s Acclaim platform, we provide digital badges to everyone who earns an AWS Certification to support recognition and verification. Each AWS Certification digital badge has an option to verify it, which checks and displays the issue date as well as the issuer (AWS Training and Certification). Links to AWS Certification digital badges are unique for each AWS Certified individual. Digital badges may also be linked from social media profiles or on personal websites.\n\nYou can also verify a digital certificate using the validation number, on the bottom right of an AWS Certification certificate. Earners download certificates from their AWS Certification Account. Once you have the validation number, you can verify the certification.\n\n\n\nAre there benefits offered to AWS Certified individuals?\n\nIn addition to validating your technical skills, AWS Certification gives you tangible benefits to help you showcase your achievement and further advance your AWS expertise. View the AWS Certification Benefits page for a complete list of benefits.\n\nWhat are AWS Certification digital badges?\n\nAWS Certification provides digital badges as a benefit of earning an AWS Certification to showcase certification status. We provide digital badges via Credly’s Acclaim platform to offer flexible options for recognition and verification. You can take advantage of one-click badge sharing on social media newsfeeds, tools for embedding verifiable badges on websites or email signatures, and an optional public profile with all earned AWS Certification badges.

    "html": "Skip to main content\nClick here to return to Amazon Web Services homepage\nContact Us\nSupport \nEnglish \nMy Account \nSign In \nCreate an AWS Account\nProducts Solutions Pricing Documentation Learn Partner Network AWS Marketplace Customer Enablement Events Explore More\nTraining and Certification\nGet Trained  \nGet Certified  \nDevelop Your Team\nAWS Partner Training  \nEducation Programs  \nAWS Cloud Institute\nBefore Testing\nHelpful information and relevant policies for AWS Certification candidates\nSECTION CONTENT\nEligibility\nExam Overview\nExam Preparation\nAccommodations Commitment\nRequesting Accommodations\nScheduling Exams\n Return to Main Information and Policy Page\nEligibility\n\nAll AWS Certifications may be earned without completing specific prerequisites. However, AWS provides recommendations for knowledge and experience that are aligned to the content and level of proficiency for each certification.\n\n\nRecommended knowledge and experience\n\nThere is no true substitute for experience. AWS recommends that you have specific hands-on experience that covers the competencies, domains, and objectives in the content outline for each exam. In addition, AWS offers multiple training courses, and resources such as whitepapers and blogs, to assist you with acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary for competent practice.\n\nAWS is committed to impartiality in all of its certification activities. We do not require or endorse any specific courses, as there are multiple methods to prepare for each certification.\n\nTeen testing policy\n\nCandidates ages 13-17 are permitted to take AWS Certification exams with the consent of a parent or legal guardian. Visit our Policies page for details.  \n\nNondiscrimination\n\nAWS endorses the principle of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination in all certification programs. Visit our Policies page for details.\n\nExam Overview\n\nEach AWS Certification exam assesses a unique, comprehensive set of knowledge, skills, and abilities that can be attained through learning and experience working with AWS products and services. Each exam samples the knowledge or skills required to perform the tasks in each of the major areas of responsibility—or domains—as defined through a job task analysis (JTA). Each exam does not attempt to test knowledge at all levels or settings in the content or practice area.\n\nAWS Certification exams are constructed according to test specifications derived from the JTA. AWS conducts these studies with qualified subject matter experts (SMEs) to establish the test specifications used to construct each exam.\n\nExam guides for each certification contain the content outline for their respective exams. Each outline includes information on its exam’s domains and objectives, as well as the percentage of questions in each domain. Get started by downloading exam guides from each exam’s webpage, which are located on our website.\n\n\nFormat\n\nThere are two types of questions on our exams:\n\nMultiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses\nMultiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more options\n\n\nSelect one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Incorrect answers are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill would likely choose. However, they are generally plausible responses that fit within the content area defined by the test objective.\n\nUnanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. Partial credit is not awarded for multiple-response questions.\n\nExam pricing\n\nThe following table shows the exam prices in local currency for countries that use the Australian Dollar, Euro, Korean Won, and Japanese Yen. Applicable taxes may apply. Prices are valid for one exam attempt.\n\nExam prices\nExam Type/Price\t USD\tEUR\tAUD\tJPY\tKRW\nFoundational\t$100\t€92\t$150\t¥15,000\t₩131,525\nAssociate\t$150\t€138\t$229\t¥20,000\t₩197,287\nProfessional\t$300\t€277\t$459\t¥40,000\t₩394,575\nSpecialty\t$300\t€277\t$459\t¥40,000\t₩394,575\n\nNote: Exam prices are updated annually in April to reflect updated foreign exchange rates for these currencies. Refer to Exam pricing policies for more information.\n\n\nExam pricing policies\nAll prices in EUR, AUD, JPY and KRW apply to countries that use the Australian dollar, euro, Korean won, and Japanese yen.\nForeign exchange rates displayed on this page do not apply to voucher purchases. For more on voucher pricing, please visit the Xvoucher website. Xvoucher is an AWS authorized reseller and distributor of AWS Certification exam vouchers.\nVouchers that are intended to cover 100% of an exam will be valid for the full exam price, regardless of the updates to foreign exchange rates. Vouchers that are intended to cover 50% of an exam will be valid for 50% off of the exam price at the time of exam purchase.\n\nIndividuals who pay for an exam with a credit card or cash will not be required to make any additional payment to reschedule their exam after the exchange rate is updated. Please note that AWS Certification exams can only be rescheduled twice.\nIndividuals who cancel their exam more than 24 hours before their scheduled appointment will be refunded the exam fee they paid at the time of purchase.\nExam descriptions\n\nAWS offers role-based certifications to validate expertise for those in Cloud Practitioner, architect, developer, and operations roles, plus Specialty certifications to validate advanced skills in specific technical areas. Details of each certification may be accessed through the AWS Certification homepage.\n\nBeta exams\n\nAWS Certification follows a rigorous process to create industry-recognized exams and credentials. Beta periods for new exams and new exam versions allow for testing the performance and quality of each question before use in a live exam.\n\nPassing a beta exam earns candidates the applicable AWS Certification. Beta exams are offered at a 50% discount from standard exam pricing, and results are made available within 90 days of the end of the beta period. Learn more about beta exams on our Coming Soon page.\n\nExam Preparation\n\nThe best preparation for AWS Certification exams is practical experience. You can find specific recommendations to prepare for each certification exam by accessing our exam preparation page.\n\n\nAdditional AWS resources\n\nAWS offers many relevant options to supplement your learning:\n\nCustomized learning paths\nDigital and instructor-led training\n\nExam readiness courses\nWhitepapers\nFree tier access to AWS services\n\nBlogs\n\nPlease note that these offerings are neither required nor endorsed, and that we recommend you still review the exam content outline. Use the outline to determine what you will need to learn in preparation for the exam. You can find preparation resources for each certification on our exam preparation page.  \n\nAWS Certification Official Practice Question Sets\n\nAWS Certification Official Practice Question Sets feature sample questions developed by AWS to demonstrate the style and depth of our certification exams. You can experience these exam-style questions, which offers detailed feedback and recommended resources to help fill gaps. AWS Certification Official Practice Question Sets are available for free on AWS Skill Builder.\n\n\nSample questions\n\nWe post sample questions on our website to provide you with an opportunity to become familiar with the format of questions used on AWS Certification exams. Sample questions are used strictly for illustrative purposes and are not indicative of actual content on the exams.\n\nAccommodations Commitment\n\nAWS Certification and their vendors are committed to providing all individuals with an opportunity to validate technical skills and cloud expertise. We will provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities to help ensure equitable access to AWS Certification.\n\n\nRequesting Accommodations\n\nReasonable accommodations are granted for applicants with documented disabilities in coordination with our test delivery provider. Special accommodations will be arranged individually and in advance with the test delivery provider.\n\n\nAccommodations must be requested prior to scheduling each exam.\n\nEnglish as a second language\n\nA 30-minute exam extension is available upon request to non-native English speakers when taking an exam in English. The accommodation, “ESL +30,” only needs to be requested once, prior to registering for an exam. It will apply to all future exam registrations with all test delivery providers. To request this accommodation, follow these steps:\n\nSign in to aws.training/Certification. \nSelect the Go to your Account button. \nSelect the Request Exam Accommodations button, followed by Request Accommodation.\nUsing the Accommodation Type dropdown, select ESL +30 MINUTES.\nSelect the Create button.\nAccommodations at Pearson VUE\n\nFor Pearson VUE-granted accommodations, candidates will be required to request accommodations directly with Pearson VUE. A candidate with an approved accommodation will be given instructions for scheduling their exam appointment over the phone. For more information and to request accommodations, visit Pearson VUE’s accommodations page.\n\nComfort aids\n\nThere are specific comfort aids, such as medicines, medical devices, and other items, that do not require prior approval. You may bring these items to test centers. Allowable comfort aids differ based on the test delivery provider.\n\n\nVisit Pearson VUE’s comfort aids page for the current list of their allowed comfort aids.\n\n\nScheduling Exams\n\nTo schedule a certification exam, you must first create an AWS Certification Account. Your AWS Certification Account is a central management tool for AWS Certification, allowing you to schedule exams and take advantage of certification benefits.\n\n\nCreating an AWS Certification Account\n\nYour AWS Certification Account uses single sign-on (SSO) authentication from your aws.training account. If you have not yet created an aws.training account, go to aws.training, select the Sign In button at the top right, and create the appropriate account for yourself as a customer, APN Partner, or Amazon employee.\n\nOnce you are signed in to your account, select Certification from the top navigation. You will be prompted to fill out basic demographic information. As you enter your first name (given name) and last name (surname) when filling out this information, be sure they match your first and last name as they appear on the identification you will be required to present at your exam appointment. If the names are not identical, you will not be permitted to take the exam. (Visit the ID Requirements section of our During Testing [Test Day] page for more information about ID requirements.)\n\n\nShould you have any account issues, visit our AWS Certification account FAQ for details on how to submit a case to AWS Training and Certification Customer Service. Account issues include the need to update the name on your account in order to match your valid identification, as well as merging multiple accounts.  \n\nTesting options\n\nAWS Certification exams are currently offered through Pearson VUE. Learn more about the AWS Certification Test Delivery Provider, Pearson VUE, on our FAQ page.\n\n\nFinding a test center\n\nTo find a testing center, visit Pearson VUE to find a date, time, and location convenient for you.\n\n\nTest center demo exam functionality\n\nYou may review basic exam functionality for Pearson VUE test centers.\n\n\nOnline proctored exams\n\nOnline proctoring is available for all AWS Certification exams from our test delivery provider Pearson VUE.

If you paid for your exam using a voucher, verify the voucher expiration date prior to modifying your existing registration. Exam voucher expiration dates cannot be extended.\nYou will not be able to cancel or reschedule your exam within 24 hours of your scheduled exam appointment. Within 24 hours of the exam time, our test delivery provider will charge the full delivery fee and refunds are not available. In cases of personal illness or unforeseen emergencies, and with appropriate documentation, the test delivery provider will waive the fee and allow the exam to be rescheduled without charging additional fees. To request an excused absence, contact Pearson VUE accordingly.\nCancellation policy\n\nYou must contact Pearson VUE (refer to the contact information above) or access your online account to cancel your exam a minimum of 24 hours prior to your appointment. Canceling your exam less than 24 hours prior to your appointment, or failing to appear for your appointment, will result in the forfeiture of your exam fee.\n\nIf you wish to reschedule your exam, sign in to your AWS Certification Account to complete the rescheduling process.\n\nCandidate information, sharing, access, and data privacy\n\nTo offer certifications, AWS needs to collect some personal information about you, but we will never sell your personal information to others. We share personal information only as described in the AWS Privacy Policy, and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to the AWS Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in the policy.\n\nThe AWS Training and Certification team complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by providing a way for European Union members to request the deletion of personal data and by providing candidates with their personal data with a description of how it is used.

We ask that you arrive at the test center 15–30 minutes before your scheduled appointment time. This will give you adequate time to complete the necessary sign-in procedures. When testing at an AWS event, be prepared for a longer check-in process. When checking in for your exam, you will be asked to provide your registration name and exam title to the test administrator. You will need to provide your forms of identification. You will need to provide a signature agreeing to the test-delivery provider’s candidate agreement. You may be required to have your photograph taken during the check-in process. Your belongings must be stored according to the instructions of the test center staff before entering the testing room. You may be required to fill out a log sheet. The test administrator will then escort you to your computer workstation.\n\n\nOnline proctoring check-in\n\nRefer to your confirmation email for instructions on how to prepare for test day. You will be able to launch your exam up to 30 minutes prior to your scheduled exam time. Please ensure that you have run the testing vendor’s system test on your computer prior to your appointment. If you are more than 15 minutes late for your appointment, or your computer does not pass the system test, you will not be able to launch your exam and your exam fees will be forfeited.\n\nOnce you have launched your exam, you will be guided through a self-check-in process to provide your identification and perform a testing environment check. When the check-in process is complete, you will be connected with a proctor to begin your exam.\n\nBefore your appointment, review all requirements and video walkthrough on Pearson VUE’s website.\n\n\nID Requirements\nGeneral ID Requirements\n\nThe first and last name on the valid primary and secondary IDs that you present at your exam appointment must be identical to the first name (given name) and last name (surname) as entered into your AWS Certification Account at the time of registration.\nPlease also note:\n\nOnly Roman (English) alphabet characters are supported on your AWS Certification Account.\nSpecial characters do not need to be present on your AWS Certification Account name to test; for example: ü or ö.

Test administrators are instructed not to allow a candidate to test if the first and last names of the IDs and their AWS Certification Account are not identical. See “Change your name” section below for instructions on how to update your AWS Account name prior to your exam date.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the ID you are required to provide for admittance for your exam, please contact Pearson VUE Customer Service.\n\nOnline Proctored Exams\n\nOne primary ID is required to test for any online proctored exam (OnVUE). Here are the guidelines for OnVUE exam ID requirements. Review the Unacceptable IDs section below. If you have any questions or concerns about the ID you are required to provide for admittance for your exam, please contact Pearson VUE Customer Service before your exam appointment.\n\nTest Center Delivered Exams\n\nTwo primary IDs, or one primary ID and one secondary ID, are required to test in a test center.

If the name on the My Profile page of your AWS Certification Account does not match your valid forms of identification, you must either change your name in your account two (2) business days before your exam or open a case with AWS Training and Certification Customer Service. Indicate that your name is incorrect on your AWS Certification Account and provide the correct name. AWS Training and Certification Customer Service will process this request as soon as possible. Do not schedule an exam until your request has been processed. Cancel an existing examination appointment before requesting an account update, and then reschedule after the request is processed to avoid confusion at the testing appointment.\n\nCustomers can change their name in their Certification account two business days (48 hours) before their first exam.\n\nTo change the name on your AWS Certification account, complete the following steps:\n\nLog in to your AWS certification account https://www.aws.training/.\nGo to the Profile tab, and then choose “Account”\nEnter your legal first and last name exactly as it appears on your government issued ID.\nSelect “Update Information”.\n\nIf the system does not allow you to make this update, then please submit a ticket to the AWS Training and Certification Support team (https://support.aws.amazon.com/#/contacts/aws-training).

Details of this policy can be found on our Policies page.\n\n\nTest centers\n\nTest center rules can be found at the following page:\n\nPearson VUE Candidate Rules Agreement\n\n\nA violation of Pearson VUE test center rules may lead to the immediate cancellation or termination of your exam without refunding or rescheduling the exam appointment.\n\nCandidate Code of Conduct\n\nWhen taking your exam at a test center, you will be presented with the Candidate Code of Conduct before your exam launches. Details of this policy can be found on our Policies page.\n\nBreaks\n\nScheduled breaks are not configured for AWS Certification exams. For exams at a test center, you are permitted to take unscheduled breaks. The time for the exam will not stop during an unscheduled break. You are not permitted to leave the building at any time during an exam.\n\nFor online proctored exams, you are not permitted to stand up from or leave the view of the camera for any reason for the duration of the exam, including for a restroom break or any other kind of break.\n\nTesting Irregularity Investigations\nInvestigation procedures\n\nAt AWS’s sole discretion, AWS may initiate an investigation into any report or information that a candidate has engaged in any conduct that is in violation of the AWS Certification Program Agreement, AWS Certification Policies, our test delivery provider's rules and regulations, or conduct that otherwise threatens the validity and security of AWS Certification exams. AWS may also initiate an investigation into a candidate’s exam performance or behavior based on data forensics analyses. Learn more about testing irregularity investigation procedures on our Policies page.\n\n\nReporting testing irregularities and policy violations\n\nThe value that AWS Certification provides is contingent upon objective, fair, and consistent application and enforcement of all testing rules, policies, and procedures. To protect that value, any candidate or AWS Certified individual who has knowledge of any testing irregularities or policy violations, whether by an AWS Certified individual, candidate, test center, or other third party, is encouraged to report that information to aws-exam-security@amazon.com for further investigation. AWS will treat reports of testing irregularities or policy violations in a confidential manner to the fullest extent possible.\n\nExam Functionality and Feedback\nExam functionality\n\nOnce seated for the exam, verify that your name and exam are showing correctly on screen. You should notify the proctor immediately if there are any discrepancies. You must agree to the on-screen Candidate Code of Conduct prior to starting the AWS Certification exam.\n\nAs a testing candidate, you can expect your behavior to be monitored throughout the test-taking period by AWS and our test delivery provider. You must complete your own exams without assistance. However, if there is a malfunction with a test computer, report the issue immediately to a test administrator or proctor, and request that they log an incident. Do not ask test center employees questions about exam content or scores, as they will be unable to assist in these matters.\n\nDuring testing, there will be a built-in timer on the computer screen that will show how much of your testing session remains. Be sure to plan wisely so that all questions can be answered in the allotted time. There are no penalties for incorrect responses. Unanswered questions will be marked as wrong. Note that the timer will continue to count down during any unscheduled breaks at a test center. If you need to step away from the testing station, you may alert the test administrator. You will be required to complete the check-in steps again to re-enter the exam. For kiosk testing and online proctored exams, no breaks are permitted.\n\n\nExam functionality overview for Pearson VUE\n\nExams delivered through Pearson VUE include the following:\n\nIntroduction screen: Displays your name and exam information.\nCandidate Code of Conduct: You are given 5 minutes to read and agree to the Candidate Code of Conduct. Failure to agree, or timing out without a response, will end the exam and no refunds will be provided.\n\nExam section:\nA timer is located in the upper-right portion of the screen. A timer warning will display when 5 minutes remain.\nThe item counter, or question counter, is located in the upper-right portion of the screen.\nThe navigation controls are located in the lower-left portion of the screen. You are allowed to go to the next and previous question throughout the exam, unless specifically noted.\nSelect the Flag for Review button in the upper-right portion of the screen to flag a question for later review.\nSelect the Comment button in the upper-left portion of the screen to enter feedback on a given question. \nAfter navigating through all of the exam questions, a review screen will appear to present you with the opportunity to review all, incomplete, or flagged questions. Select the End Review button to exit the exam section.  \nSurvey section: Candidates are given 5 minutes to complete the end-of-exam survey questions.\nExit screen: Provides information on exam results. Select the End Exam button to close out of the exam.\nExam feedback\n\nThe test delivery provider provides a Comment button on-screen for each question while you take an exam. However, the time taken to post comments is subtracted from the exam time limit. Therefore, we recommend that you flag individual questions and add any comments when you have completed your exam. Comments regarding question content or translation accuracy may be captured by selecting the Comment button on a particular question, entering the comment, and selecting Save. Comments are linked to the question where the comment was entered. All comments are reviewed by AWS in aggregate and carefully considered during technical and psychometric reviews.

Learn more »\tLast date to take this exam: April 29, 2024\nFAQ\nWhat is an exam guide?\n\nAWS Certification exam guides include the content outline and relevant details for a certification exam. Creating an exam guide is a critical component in our rigorous process for industry-recognized exams and credentials.\n\nWhy is there a new exam guide for an existing AWS Certification?\n\nWe develop new exam outlines to maintain the currency of our certification exams. We also provide a revised exam guide when an outline changes.\n\n\nFor exams with new versions that are coming soon, which exam should I take?\n\nWe encourage candidates to review exam guides carefully and consider how long they need to prepare for an exam. They should also consider exam availability dates when making a decision about which version to take. Passing a beta exam or standard exam will result in earning an AWS Certification valid for three years.\n\nHow frequently are exams updated?\n\nAWS Certifications are designed to validate experience and knowledge of current AWS technology and best practices. Domains and objectives for each certification are carefully created by AWS subject matter experts. Once a certification is available, exams are refreshed on an ongoing basis. AWS subject matter experts will update domains and objectives as needed to reflect new AWS technology or best practices. The frequency varies by exam. If you’re interested in taking part in our rigorous approach to creating and updating our exams, learn more about our SME program.\n\nWhat is a beta exam?\n\nAWS Certification uses beta exams to test exam item performance before use in a live exam. An exam may go through the beta process before the exam is launched for the first time. AWS Certification may also complete a beta process when an exam outline changes.\n\n\nWhy should I take a beta exam?\n\nBeta candidates have the opportunity to take the newest exams first and to participate in data gathering about the performance of exam questions. For new exams, candidates who pass the exam can be among the first to hold the new certification. In addition, beta exams are typically offered at 50% off standard exam pricing.\n\nWhat happens if I pass the beta?\n\nCandidates who pass the beta exam will be awarded the AWS Certification once scores are released, typically 90 days from the end of the beta period. Your certification will be valid for three years from the day scores are released.\n\nWhat happens if I do not pass the beta exam?\n\nIndividuals who participate in beta exams but do not pass can retake the exam once the standard version is released. A passing score on the beta or standard exam is required to earn the certification.\n\nWhy is there a beta exam for an existing AWS Certification exam?\n\nWe develop new exam outlines to ensure our certification exams reflect the latest best practices and provide a revised exam guide when an outline changes. A beta period for the updated version allows us to gather statistical information about new questions that fit the new outline.\n\n\nWhy is there not a beta exam for an existing AWS Certification exam that is being updated?\n\nMinor exam outline changes may not require a beta exam. When AWS Certification determines a minor exam outline change is required, we test exam item performance through unscored items on the current version of the exam.\n\n\nWhere do I take the beta exam?\n\nBeta exams are delivered by our test delivery provider Pearson VUE. Testing centers are available in thousands of locations across the globe and online proctored appointments are available to schedule.\n\n\nWhy is beta registration limited?\n\nWe offer beta versions of new exams in order to gather statistical information about new questions that fit the new outline. Once we reach our capacity for this statistical analysis, we may close registration for a given beta exam. Anyone who has already registered will have the opportunity to complete their beta exam as scheduled.\n\nWhat languages are beta exams available in?\n\nBeta exams are available only in English. We anticipate more languages will be available once the exam is released in full.\n\nWhat prerequisites are required to take these beta exams?\n\nThere are no prerequisites for our AWS Certification exams, including beta exams. In October 2018, we removed prerequisites to give candidates more flexibility for our exams.  \n\nHave more questions?

    "html": "Skip to main content\nClick here to return to Amazon Web Services homepage\nContact Us\nSupport \nEnglish \nMy Account \nSign In \nCreate an AWS Account\nProducts Solutions Pricing Documentation Learn Partner Network AWS Marketplace Customer Enablement Events Explore More\nTraining and Certification\nGet Trained  \nGet Certified  \nDevelop Your Team\nAWS Partner Training  \nEducation Programs  \nAWS Cloud Institute\nGeneral Policies\nHelpful information and relevant policies for AWS Certification candidates\n\nGeneral AWS Certification policies are described on this page. For details on specific testing-related policies, please visit the Additional Policies section at the bottom of this page.\n\n\nSECTION CONTENT\nNondiscrimination\nCandidate Program Agreement\nCandidate Code of Conduct\nTesting Irregularity Investigation Process\nTeen Testing Policy\nBrand Usage and Guidelines\nAdditional Policies\n Return to Main Information and Policy Page\nNondiscrimination\n\nAWS endorses the principle of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination in all certification programs and prohibits discrimination against its applicants, candidates, certified persons, staff, and volunteers with regard to age, sex, ethnic origin, race, religion, disability, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation, or any other category protected by federal or state law. All AWS decisions related to certification (including granting, suspending, and withdrawing a credential) are made impartially and are free from discriminatory judgments.\n\n\nCandidate Program Agreement\n\nGeneral: The AWS Certification Program Agreement (the “CPA”) contains terms that govern your participation in the AWS Certification program. The CPA is a contractual arrangement between AWS and any individual who registers for an AWS Certification exam.\n\nNon-compliance: If AWS, in its sole discretion, determines that you violated the terms of the CPA, your exam scores may be canceled, your AWS Certification(s) may be revoked, you may be required to retake an exam, or you may be prohibited from participating in the AWS Certification program.\n\nData forensics: AWS uses data forensics to identify statistically anomalous exam results. Data forensics is used as a basis for taking enforcement action when there is no reasonable explanation for a statistically anomalous exam result. When the validity of an exam result is in question based on forensic analysis, AWS may invalidate the exam score and revoke the related certification before notifying the affected candidate of next steps. AWS may also require candidates to retake the exam at a mutually agreeable time and at a location chosen by AWS, or candidates may be prohibited from participating in the AWS Certification program in the future. Please visit the Data Forensics page to get more complete information about the data forensics program.\n\n\nCandidate Code of Conduct\n\nYou will be presented with the Candidate Code of Conduct before your exam launches. The Candidate Code of Conduct serves to remind you of conduct that threatens the integrity, validity, and security of AWS Certification exams and that you previously agreed to refrain from such conduct when you accepted the terms of the CPA during exam registration. If you do not agree to the Candidate Code of Conduct, your exam will be terminated and you will not receive a refund.\n\n\nTesting Irregularity Investigation Process\n\nIf a candidate is the subject of an investigation by AWS, the candidate must fully cooperate with the investigation, produce all documents, materials, and information requested by AWS, and truthfully and completely answer all questions presented to the candidate, whether by email, phone, in person, or any other method. Failure or refusal to cooperate with AWS’s investigation, or the presentation of false or misleading information to AWS or its representatives in the course of an AWS investigation, shall constitute a breach of the CPA and serve as a separate and independent basis for AWS to take action against the candidate’s certification(s).\n\nIf an exam proctor determines that a candidate violated testing rules or procedures while an exam session is ongoing, the session may be terminated. If after an exam session has ended the test delivery provider or AWS determine that a candidate has violated testing rules or procedures, or if a violation detected during the exam session requires additional sanctions beyond terminating the session, AWS will notify the candidate by email about the violation and the sanctions. In addition to the violation and sanctions, the email will outline the appeals process for challenging AWS’s decision, which is also outlined in the following sections. It is the candidate’s responsibility to ensure that the email address associated with their AWS Certification Account is current, checked frequently, and accepts emails from aws-exam-security@amazon.com.\n\n\nSanctions\n\nAny candidate who violates testing rules, policies, or procedures may be subject to the following actions or sanctions, including but not limited to:\n\n\nWarning\nInvalidation of certification exam results without receiving a refund or any other form of compensation\n\nRequired retake of the exam by redeeming a voucher provided by AWS. AWS will determine the criteria for retaking the exam including how and where the exam may be administered and a deadline by which the retake must occur\n\nRestrict exam delivery modality for future certification exam(s)\n\nRevocation of the certification related to the violation\nRevocation of all AWS Certification(s)\nProhibited from participating in the AWS Certification program for a limited or indefinite period of time\n\nAppeals\n\nCandidates who have received a written notice that they are prohibited from participating in the AWS Certification Program in accordance with the CPA may appeal the conclusions and sanction(s) within 14 calendar days from the date AWS sent the notice to the candidate. Candidates must follow the appeal instructions provided in the notice. Candidates will be required to provide a written statement describing the basis of their appeal and a response to any specific questions/requests from AWS, why the appeal should be granted, and all evidence that supports the candidate’s appeal. AWS will not consider appeals received more than 14 calendar days after the date AWS sent the notice. All evidence supporting the appeal must be included when the initial appeal statement is submitted. Any evidence provided to AWS after the initial appeal statement is submitted will not be reviewed unless specifically requested by AWS.\n\nThe AWS Certification Security team (“the Security team”) will review the statement and evidence provided by the candidate and investigate further if necessary. If further investigation reveals additional evidence or violations of AWS policy, the Security team will notify the candidate and provide them with an opportunity to respond to any new allegations. If the Security team overturns sanctions that prohibit a candidate from participating in the AWS Certification Program, the candidate will be notified.\n\nThe Certification Candidate Appeals Committee (“the Committee”) is responsible for reviewing appeals if the Security team does not lift sanctions prohibiting a candidate from participating in the AWS Certification Program and the facts and claims of the appeal are substantially different from appeals previously adjudicated by the Committee. The Security team will present their investigative findings and the appeal statement and evidence to the Security Manager or the Security Manager’s designee for review. The Security Manager, in their sole discretion, will determine whether the facts of the violation, appeal statement, and additional evidence are substantially similar to prior cases resolved by the Committee. If the Security Manager does find substantial similarity with any prior cases resolved by the Committee, the Security Manager will decide the outcome of the appeal consistent with prior precedent established by the Committee. If the Security Manager does not find substantial similarity, the appeal will be presented to the Committee and the Committee’s decision to uphold, reduce, or overturn any sanctions will be final.\n\n\nThe Committee will consist of at least three members of the AWS Certification team who did not investigate, sanction, or collaborate on the matter that is being appealed. The Committee will review the sanctions, collaborate, and decide whether each individual sanction should be upheld, reduced, or removed. The decision to uphold or reduce an individual sanction will be determined by the majority vote of the Committee. The Committee may not increase the severity of any sanction under review.\n\nAfter the Security Manager or the Committee has rendered a decision, the Security team will communicate that decision to the candidate and ensure that any sanctions that were reduced or removed are appropriately resolved. The decision by the Security Manager or the Committee is final, and the candidate’s only recourse to challenge the decision is through arbitration as specified in the AWS Customer Agreement.\n\n\nTeen Testing Policy\n\nCandidates ages 13-17 are permitted to take AWS Certification exams with the consent of their parent or legal guardian. Candidates must be at least 13 years old at the time of scheduling an exam. This special process is outlined below:\n\n1. Create an AWS Certification Account: The parent or legal guardian must create an AWS Certification Account for their teenage candidate, and the account must be in their teenage candidate’s name. After creating the account, note the Candidate ID found in the top right corner of the page. This will be needed in step 2 below.\n\n\n2. Open a customer service case: The parent or legal guardian must next open a customer service case with AWS Training and Certification. In order to avoid delays in processing requests for their teenager(s) to take the test, the parent or legal guardian must enter the following information into the case form’s fields:\n\nFirst Name: Enter the parent/legal guardian’s first name\nLast Name: Enter the parent/legal guardian’s last name\nCompany Name: Enter the teenage candidate’s first and last name\nEmail Address: Enter the parent/legal guardian’s email address\nCountry/Region: Select your applicable country/region\nTelephone: Enter the parent/legal guardian’s telephone number\nInquiry Type: Select “Certification”\nAdditional Details: Select “Scheduling/Accommodations”\nHow can we help you?: Enter the phrase “Teenage Candidate” immediately followed by the login ID from the teenage candidate’s AWS Certification Account\n\nPlease note: If a teenage candidate files the initial ticket, they will need to have their parent or legal guardian submit a new ticket completed properly to initiate the process.\n\n3. Complete a consent form: AWS Customer Service will respond to your customer service case with further instructions. Reply to the customer support email and attach the completed customer support form (available below). The parental/legal guardian consent form must be completed by both the teenage candidate and the parent/legal guardian who will accompany the teenage candidate to their scheduled appointment.\n\nParental Consent Forms \nEnglish Parental Consent Form \nFrench Parental Consent Form \nGerman Parental Consent Form \nIndonesian Parental Consent Form \nItalian Parental Consent Form \nJapanese Parental Consent Form \nKorean Parental Consent Form \nPortuguese Parental Consent Form \nSimplified Chinese Parental Consent Form \nSpanish Parental Consent Form \n4. After consent form approval, assist in scheduling the exam: Approximately five to seven business days after receipt of the consent form, AWS Customer Service will either notify the parent/legal guardian if any further information is needed, or if the consent form is approved. Upon receiving that copy of the approved form, the parent/legal guardian may then assist their teenage candidate in scheduling an AWS Certification exam. They may do so by signing in to their AWS Certification Account and selecting “Pearson VUE” as the test delivery provider for the appropriate exam.\n\n5. Follow proper identification (ID) steps on the day of the exam appointment:\n\nThe teenage candidate must present one form of photo ID. School IDs are acceptable.\nThe parent/legal guardian who is identified on the consent form must accompany the teen candidate to the test center and provide a valid, government-issued ID that matches the name listed on the consent form, as well as a copy of the consent form.\nThe parent/legal guardian must sign the log sheet next to the candidate’s signature in order to verify the candidate’s identity.\nThe parent/legal guardian is not permitted to wait in the test center after the admission process is completed.\n\nBecause certification exam policies often change, the scheduling process above must be repeated, and a new consent form completed and submitted, for each AWS Certification exam taken by a teenage candidate.\n\nBrand Usage and Guidelines\n\nAWS Certification digital badges are a way to visually portray your AWS Certification achievement. We provide digital badges as a benefit of earning an AWS Certification to showcase certification status. AWS Certification digital badges are provided via Credly’s Acclaim platform and can be accessed, along with all your AWS Certified benefits, from your AWS Certification Account. You can use the sharing features within Credly’s Acclaim platform to post your badge on your social media newsfeeds and add your digital badge to your professional profile.\n\nUsage rules\n\nAWS Certification badges should be featured in an unaltered state, on white or very light backgrounds that are devoid of distracting patterns or imagery, with the appropriate taglines place below the logo. Do not take any of the following actions:\n\nDistorting the badge\nAltering the badge\nAltering the colors\nOverlaying graphics or text\nPlacing the badge on a patterned background\nPlacing the badge over busy imagery\nPlacing the badge on a background with low contrast\nLegal guidelines\n\nAWS authorizes the use of the AWS Certification Mark in accordance with the rules set forth below:\n\nAWS Certification requires meeting specific certification requirements, including passing an AWS Certification exam. Only individuals who have been certified by an official AWS test provider are allowed to use the AWS Certification Mark.\nThe AWS Certification Mark may only be used in connection with you presenting yourself as an AWS Certified individual. This AWS Certification Mark is non-transferable.\nThe AWS Certification Mark may only be reproduced from approved artwork and may not be recreated by any other means, in any other form, or altered in any way, including the use of unapproved taglines, abbreviations, or translations.\nThe AWS Certification Mark must never be used to portray AWS products and/or services in a negative way.\nThe AWS Certification Mark may not be combined with any other symbols, including words, other logos, icons, graphics, photos, slogans, numbers, or any other design elements.\nThe AWS Certification Mark may not be used to imply or suggest that:\nYou have achieved a level of certification that you have not achieved or do not currently have;\nAny partnership, joint venture, or other relationship exists between you and AWS; or that\n\nAWS recommends or endorses your services.\nYou shall make any revisions respecting the AWS Certification Mark in such materials that AWS may request.\n\nYour acceptance of the AWS Certification Mark indicates your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these guidelines and reconfirms your acceptance of the AWS Certification Program Agreement. AWS reserves the right to change these guidelines and the nature of this program at its own discretion.\n\nAdditional Policies\n\nFor details on specific testing-related policies, please select the links for the appropriate pages below:\n\n\nBefore Testing: testing accommodations, English as a Second Language (ESL), sanctioned countries\n\nDuring Testing (Test Day): ID requirements, test center policies, sanctioned and embargoed countries\nAfter Testing: scoring and reporting, retake policy\n\nLearn About AWS\nWhat Is AWS?\nWhat Is Cloud Computing?\nAWS Inclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWhat Is DevOps?\nWhat Is a Container?\nWhat Is a Data Lake?\nWhat is Generative AI?\nAWS Cloud Security\nWhat's New\nBlogs\nPress Releases\nResources for AWS\nGetting Started\nTraining and Certification\nAWS Solutions Library\nArchitecture Center\nProduct and Technical FAQs\nAnalyst Reports\nAWS Partners\nDevelopers on AWS\nDeveloper Center\nSDKs & Tools\n.NET on AWS\nPython on AWS\nJava on AWS\nPHP on AWS\nJavaScript on AWS\nHelp\nContact Us\nGet Expert Help\nFile a Support Ticket\nAWS re:Post\nKnowledge Center\nAWS Support Overview\nLegal\nAWS Careers\nCreate an AWS Account\nAmazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer: Minority / Women / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation / Age.\nLanguage عربي Bahasa Indonesia Deutsch English Español Français Italiano Português Tiếng Việt Türkçe Ρусский ไทย 日本語 한국어 中文 (简体) 中文 (繁體)\nPrivacy | Site Terms | Cookie Preferences | © 2024, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

However, AWS provides recommendations for knowledge and experience that are aligned to the content and level of proficiency for each certification.\n\n\nRecommended knowledge and experience\n\nThere is no true substitute for experience. AWS recommends that you have specific hands-on experience that covers the competencies, domains, and objectives in the content outline for each exam. In addition, AWS offers multiple training courses, and resources such as whitepapers and blogs, to assist you with acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary for competent practice.\n\nAWS is committed to impartiality in all of its certification activities. We do not require or endorse any specific courses, as there are multiple methods to prepare for each certification.\n\nTeen testing policy\n\nCandidates ages 13-17 are permitted to take AWS Certification exams with the consent of a parent or legal guardian. Visit our Policies page for details.  \n\nNondiscrimination\n\nAWS endorses the principle of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination in all certification programs. Visit our Policies page for details.\n\nExam Overview\n\nEach AWS Certification exam assesses a unique, comprehensive set of knowledge, skills, and abilities that can be attained through learning and experience working with AWS products and services. Each exam samples the knowledge or skills required to perform the tasks in each of the major areas of responsibility—or domains—as defined through a job task analysis (JTA). Each exam does not attempt to test knowledge at all levels or settings in the content or practice area.\n\nAWS Certification exams are constructed according to test specifications derived from the JTA. AWS conducts these studies with qualified subject matter experts (SMEs) to establish the test specifications used to construct each exam.\n\nExam guides for each certification contain the content outline for their respective exams. Each outline includes information on its exam’s domains and objectives, as well as the percentage of questions in each domain. Get started by downloading exam guides from each exam’s webpage, which are located on our website.\n\n\nFormat\n\nThere are two types of questions on our exams:\n\nMultiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses\nMultiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more options\n\n\nSelect one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Incorrect answers are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill would likely choose. However, they are generally plausible responses that fit within the content area defined by the test objective.\n\nUnanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing.

Our test delivery providers are committed to complying with applicable laws in the countries in which we operate, including international sanctions that may restrict us from providing services in, or to residents of, certain countries. A list of countries where AWS exams are delivered may be found during exam scheduling for Pearson VUE test centers.\n\nTo sit for an AWS Certification exam, you must provide valid government-issued identification establishing residence in a non-sanctioned country.

Learn more »\tLast date to take this exam: April 29, 2024\nFAQ\nWhat is an exam guide?\n\nAWS Certification exam guides include the content outline and relevant details for a certification exam. Creating an exam guide is a critical component in our rigorous process for industry-recognized exams and credentials.\n\nWhy is there a new exam guide for an existing AWS Certification?\n\nWe develop new exam outlines to maintain the currency of our certification exams. We also provide a revised exam guide when an outline changes.\n\n\nFor exams with new versions that are coming soon, which exam should I take?\n\nWe encourage candidates to review exam guides carefully and consider how long they need to prepare for an exam. They should also consider exam availability dates when making a decision about which version to take. Passing a beta exam or standard exam will result in earning an AWS Certification valid for three years.\n\nHow frequently are exams updated?\n\nAWS Certifications are designed to validate experience and knowledge of current AWS technology and best practices. Domains and objectives for each certification are carefully created by AWS subject matter experts. Once a certification is available, exams are refreshed on an ongoing basis. AWS subject matter experts will update domains and objectives as needed to reflect new AWS technology or best practices. The frequency varies by exam. If you’re interested in taking part in our rigorous approach to creating and updating our exams, learn more about our SME program.\n\nWhat is a beta exam?\n\nAWS Certification uses beta exams to test exam item performance before use in a live exam. An exam may go through the beta process before the exam is launched for the first time. AWS Certification may also complete a beta process when an exam outline changes.\n\n\nWhy should I take a beta exam?\n\nBeta candidates have the opportunity to take the newest exams first and to participate in data gathering about the performance of exam questions. For new exams, candidates who pass the exam can be among the first to hold the new certification. In addition, beta exams are typically offered at 50% off standard exam pricing.\n\nWhat happens if I pass the beta?\n\nCandidates who pass the beta exam will be awarded the AWS Certification once scores are released, typically 90 days from the end of the beta period. Your certification will be valid for three years from the day scores are released.\n\nWhat happens if I do not pass the beta exam?\n\nIndividuals who participate in beta exams but do not pass can retake the exam once the standard version is released. A passing score on the beta or standard exam is required to earn the certification.\n\nWhy is there a beta exam for an existing AWS Certification exam?\n\nWe develop new exam outlines to ensure our certification exams reflect the latest best practices and provide a revised exam guide when an outline changes. A beta period for the updated version allows us to gather statistical information about new questions that fit the new outline.\n\n\nWhy is there not a beta exam for an existing AWS Certification exam that is being updated?\n\nMinor exam outline changes may not require a beta exam. When AWS Certification determines a minor exam outline change is required, we test exam item performance through unscored items on the current version of the exam.\n\n\nWhere do I take the beta exam?\n\nBeta exams are delivered by our test delivery provider Pearson VUE. Testing centers are available in thousands of locations across the globe and online proctored appointments are available to schedule.\n\n\nWhy is beta registration limited?\n\nWe offer beta versions of new exams in order to gather statistical information about new questions that fit the new outline. Once we reach our capacity for this statistical analysis, we may close registration for a given beta exam. Anyone who has already registered will have the opportunity to complete their beta exam as scheduled.\n\nWhat languages are beta exams available in?\n\nBeta exams are available only in English. We anticipate more languages will be available once the exam is released in full.\n\nWhat prerequisites are required to take these beta exams?\n\nThere are no prerequisites for our AWS Certification exams, including beta exams. In October 2018, we removed prerequisites to give candidates more flexibility for our exams.  \n\nHave more questions?

We encourage you to identify the most convenient testing option for you based on where you would like to take your exams and any specific accommodations you may need.\n\n\nOnline Proctoring\n\nOnline proctoring is a testing environment that allows you to take an exam from any private space, such as your home or office. You use your own computer for the exam, and converse with a proctor who remotely monitors your exam via both a screen-sharing application and your webcam. Most exam appointments are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

You will use the testing center computer to take your exam, and on-site staff will assist you with checking in and storing your belongings.

To maintain our high bar for earning an AWS Certification, our exams are taken in a proctored, timed environment. We offer flexible, convenient options for taking exams so you can select what works best for you.\n\nWe offer AWS Certification exams globally through our test delivery provider Pearson VUE. We encourage you to identify the most convenient testing option for you based on where you would like to take your exams and any specific accommodations you may need.\n\n\nOnline Proctoring\n\nOnline proctoring is a testing environment that allows you to take an exam from any private space, such as your home or office. You use your own computer for the exam, and converse with a proctor who remotely monitors your exam via both a screen-sharing application and your webcam. Most exam appointments are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We recommend scheduling your exam in advance so you’re more likely to find a time that's convenient for you.\n\n\nOnline proctoring is available for all AWS Certification exams from our test delivery providers Pearson VUE.

You will use the testing center computer to take your exam, and on-site staff will assist you with checking in and storing your belongings. Appointment availability varies by testing center.\n\nTo find a testing center near you, search availability by ZIP Code.\n\n\nNote: Some testing centers are currently closed based on local health guidance. Please refer to information from Pearson VUE to learn more and to confirm the latest health and safety measures.\n\n\nScheduling Your Exam\n\nFrom your AWS Certification Account, you can schedule your exam with Pearson VUE.

To learn more about the benefits of AWS Certification, go here.\n\nHow do I register to take an AWS Certification exam?\n\nTo register for an exam, sign in to aws.training and click Certification in the top navigation. Next, click the AWS Certification Account button, followed by Schedule New Exam. Find the exam you wish to take and click the Schedule at Pearson VUE button. You will then be redirected to the test delivery provider’s scheduling page, where you will complete your exam registration.\n\nWhat is the retake policy?\n\nIf you fail an exam, you must wait 14 calendar days before you are eligible to retake the exam. There is no limit on exam attempts. However, you must pay the full registration fee for each exam attempt. Once you have passed an exam, you will not be able to retake the same exam for two years. If the exam has been updated with a new exam guide and exam series code, you will be eligible to take the new exam version.\n\nNote that beta exam test takers can take the beta version only once, after which they will need to wait to retake the exam when the official certification exam becomes generally available.\n\n\nWill I see my preliminary exam results, pass/fail, on the screen upon completing my test?\n\nMost AWS Certification exams do not display your pass/fail result at the end of the test. Your detailed exam results will be available within five business days of completing your exam in your AWS Certification Account, under Exam History. If you pass your exam, you may receive your Credly digital badge email notification before your exam results are posted to your AWS Certification Account. Credly is our approved digital badge provider.\n\nOnly the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam will display your pass/fail result at the end of the test.\n\nWhen will I get my exam results?\n\nYour detailed exam results will be available within five business days of completing your exam in your AWS Certification Account, under Exam History.\n\nBeta exam results are typically available 90 days (13 weeks) or less from the close of the beta exam.

You can cancel or reschedule your exam up to 24 hours before your scheduled appointment without additional fees. To reschedule or cancel your exam, go to your AWS Certification Account and click the Manage Pearson VUE exams button. Select the scheduled exam you wish to manage from the Upcoming Appointments menu. Once you reach the 24-hour window before your scheduled appointment, you will not be able to cancel or reschedule your exam. If you miss your scheduled exam appointment, you will forfeit the exam fee and are not eligible for a refund (see medical exception below). You will not be able to register again for the exam until 24 hours after your missed exam time. Missing the exam does not result in a “fail” status.\n\nTo receive support for a cancellation or a missed exam, due to a medical emergency contact your test vendor: Pearson VUE.\n\nFor personal illness (with medical documentation) or for unforeseen emergency situations (documentation required), the test delivery vendors will waive the fee and allow a reschedule without fees. In emergency situations, you will be required to provide official documentation of the emergency event. This policy is noted and digitally agreed to in the test registration agreement and in the exam appointment confirmation email. Pearson VUE staff will respond to your ticket within a period of 5 business days (weekends and holidays are not included). Note: If you do not receive a response from the vendor after 5 business days, please reply to this email with their ticket number for further assistance.\n\nPlease note that you may only reschedule two times after scheduling your original appointment. If you wish to reschedule a third time, you must cancel and schedule a new appointment. The reschedule limit will apply to the new appointment. Exam appointments cannot be cancelled less than 24 hours prior to your appointment.\n\nHow can I verify an individual's certification status?\n\nTo verify an AWS Certification, ask the earner for an AWS Certification digital badge link. Via Credly’s Acclaim platform, we provide digital badges to everyone who earns an AWS Certification to support recognition and verification. Each AWS Certification digital badge has an option to verify it, which checks and displays the issue date as well as the issuer (AWS Training and Certification). Links to AWS Certification digital badges are unique for each AWS Certified individual. Digital badges may also be linked from social media profiles or on personal websites.\n\nYou can also verify a digital certificate using the validation number, on the bottom right of an AWS Certification certificate. Earners download certificates from their AWS Certification Account. Once you have the validation number, you can verify the certification.\n\n\n\nAre there benefits offered to AWS Certified individuals?\n\nIn addition to validating your technical skills, AWS Certification gives you tangible benefits to help you showcase your achievement and further advance your AWS expertise. View the AWS Certification Benefits page for a complete list of benefits.\n\nWhat are AWS Certification digital badges?\n\nAWS Certification provides digital badges as a benefit of earning an AWS Certification to showcase certification status. We provide digital badges via Credly’s Acclaim platform to offer flexible options for recognition and verification. You can take advantage of one-click badge sharing on social media newsfeeds, tools for embedding verifiable badges on websites or email signatures, and an optional public profile with all earned AWS Certification badges.

To learn more about the benefits of AWS Certification, go here.\n\nHow do I register to take an AWS Certification exam?\n\nTo register for an exam, sign in to aws.training and click Certification in the top navigation. Next, click the AWS Certification Account button, followed by Schedule New Exam. Find the exam you wish to take and click the Schedule at Pearson VUE button. You will then be redirected to the test delivery provider’s scheduling page, where you will complete your exam registration.\n\nWhat is the retake policy?\n\nIf you fail an exam, you must wait 14 calendar days before you are eligible to retake the exam. There is no limit on exam attempts. However, you must pay the full registration fee for each exam attempt. Once you have passed an exam, you will not be able to retake the same exam for two years. If the exam has been updated with a new exam guide and exam series code, you will be eligible to take the new exam version.\n\nNote that beta exam test takers can take the beta version only once, after which they will need to wait to retake the exam when the official certification exam becomes generally available.\n\n\nWill I see my preliminary exam results, pass/fail, on the screen upon completing my test?\n\nMost AWS Certification exams do not display your pass/fail result at the end of the test. Your detailed exam results will be available within five business days of completing your exam in your AWS Certification Account, under Exam History. If you pass your exam, you may receive your Credly digital badge email notification before your exam results are posted to your AWS Certification Account. Credly is our approved digital badge provider.\n\nOnly the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam will display your pass/fail result at the end of the test.\n\nWhen will I get my exam results?\n\nYour detailed exam results will be available within five business days of completing your exam in your AWS Certification Account, under Exam History.\n\nBeta exam results are typically available 90 days (13 weeks) or less from the close of the beta exam. You will be notified via email once your exam results are available in your AWS Certification Account.\n\n\nIs there an option to reschedule my exam if I cannot make my scheduled appointment?\n\nYes. You can cancel or reschedule your exam up to 24 hours before your scheduled appointment without additional fees. To reschedule or cancel your exam, go to your AWS Certification Account and click the Manage Pearson VUE exams button. Select the scheduled exam you wish to manage from the Upcoming Appointments menu. Once you reach the 24-hour window before your scheduled appointment, you will not be able to cancel or reschedule your exam. If you miss your scheduled exam appointment, you will forfeit the exam fee and are not eligible for a refund (see medical exception below). You will not be able to register again for the exam until 24 hours after your missed exam time. Missing the exam does not result in a “fail” status.\n\nTo receive support for a cancellation or a missed exam, due to a medical emergency contact your test vendor: Pearson VUE.\n\nFor personal illness (with medical documentation) or for unforeseen emergency situations (documentation required), the test delivery vendors will waive the fee and allow a reschedule without fees. In emergency situations, you will be required to provide official documentation of the emergency event. This policy is noted and digitally agreed to in the test registration agreement and in the exam appointment confirmation email. Pearson VUE staff will respond to your ticket within a period of 5 business days (weekends and holidays are not included). Note: If you do not receive a response from the vendor after 5 business days, please reply to this email with their ticket number for further assistance.\n\nPlease note that you may only reschedule two times after scheduling your original appointment. If you wish to reschedule a third time, you must cancel and schedule a new appointment. The reschedule limit will apply to the new appointment. Exam appointments cannot be cancelled less than 24 hours prior to your appointment.\n\nHow can I verify an individual's certification status?\n\nTo verify an AWS Certification, ask the earner for an AWS Certification digital badge link. Via Credly’s Acclaim platform, we provide digital badges to everyone who earns an AWS Certification to support recognition and verification. Each AWS Certification digital badge has an option to verify it, which checks and displays the issue date as well as the issuer (AWS Training and Certification). Links to AWS Certification digital badges are unique for each AWS Certified individual. Digital badges may also be linked from social media profiles or on personal websites.\n\nYou can also verify a digital certificate using the validation number, on the bottom right of an AWS Certification certificate. Earners download certificates from their AWS Certification Account. Once you have the validation number, you can verify the certification.\n\n\n\nAre there benefits offered to AWS Certified individuals?\n\nIn addition to validating your technical skills, AWS Certification gives you tangible benefits to help you showcase your achievement and further advance your AWS expertise. View the AWS Certification Benefits page for a complete list of benefits.\n\nWhat are AWS Certification digital badges?\n\nAWS Certification provides digital badges as a benefit of earning an AWS Certification to showcase certification status. We provide digital badges via Credly’s Acclaim platform to offer flexible options for recognition and verification. You can take advantage of one-click badge sharing on social media newsfeeds, tools for embedding verifiable badges on websites or email signatures, and an optional public profile with all earned AWS Certification badges.

However, AWS provides recommendations for knowledge and experience that are aligned to the content and level of proficiency for each certification.\n\n\nRecommended knowledge and experience\n\nThere is no true substitute for experience. AWS recommends that you have specific hands-on experience that covers the competencies, domains, and objectives in the content outline for each exam. In addition, AWS offers multiple training courses, and resources such as whitepapers and blogs, to assist you with acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary for competent practice.\n\nAWS is committed to impartiality in all of its certification activities. We do not require or endorse any specific courses, as there are multiple methods to prepare for each certification.\n\nTeen testing policy\n\nCandidates ages 13-17 are permitted to take AWS Certification exams with the consent of a parent or legal guardian. Visit our Policies page for details.  \n\nNondiscrimination\n\nAWS endorses the principle of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination in all certification programs. Visit our Policies page for details.\n\nExam Overview\n\nEach AWS Certification exam assesses a unique, comprehensive set of knowledge, skills, and abilities that can be attained through learning and experience working with AWS products and services. Each exam samples the knowledge or skills required to perform the tasks in each of the major areas of responsibility—or domains—as defined through a job task analysis (JTA). Each exam does not attempt to test knowledge at all levels or settings in the content or practice area.\n\nAWS Certification exams are constructed according to test specifications derived from the JTA. AWS conducts these studies with qualified subject matter experts (SMEs) to establish the test specifications used to construct each exam.\n\nExam guides for each certification contain the content outline for their respective exams. Each outline includes information on its exam’s domains and objectives, as well as the percentage of questions in each domain. Get started by downloading exam guides from each exam’s webpage, which are located on our website.\n\n\nFormat\n\nThere are two types of questions on our exams:\n\nMultiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses\nMultiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more options\n\n\nSelect one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Incorrect answers are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill would likely choose. However, they are generally plausible responses that fit within the content area defined by the test objective.\n\nUnanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. Partial credit is not awarded for multiple-response questions.\n\nExam pricing\n\nThe following table shows the exam prices in local currency for countries that use the Australian Dollar, Euro, Korean Won, and Japanese Yen. Applicable taxes may apply. Prices are valid for one exam attempt.\n\nExam prices\nExam Type/Price\t USD\tEUR\tAUD\tJPY\tKRW\nFoundational\t$100\t€92\t$150\t¥15,000\t₩131,525\nAssociate\t$150\t€138\t$229\t¥20,000\t₩197,287\nProfessional\t$300\t€277\t$459\t¥40,000\t₩394,575\nSpecialty\t$300\t€277\t$459\t¥40,000\t₩394,575\n\nNote: Exam prices are updated annually in April to reflect updated foreign exchange rates for these currencies. Refer to Exam pricing policies for more information.\n\n\nExam pricing policies\nAll prices in EUR, AUD, JPY and KRW apply to countries that use the Australian dollar, euro, Korean won, and Japanese yen.\nForeign exchange rates displayed on this page do not apply to voucher purchases. For more on voucher pricing, please visit the Xvoucher website. Xvoucher is an AWS authorized reseller and distributor of AWS Certification exam vouchers.\nVouchers that are intended to cover 100% of an exam will be valid for the full exam price, regardless of the updates to foreign exchange rates. Vouchers that are intended to cover 50% of an exam will be valid for 50% off of the exam price at the time of exam purchase.\n\nIndividuals who pay for an exam with a credit card or cash will not be required to make any additional payment to reschedule their exam after the exchange rate is updated. Please note that AWS Certification exams can only be rescheduled twice.\nIndividuals who cancel their exam more than 24 hours before their scheduled appointment will be refunded the exam fee they paid at the time of purchase.\nExam descriptions\n\nAWS offers role-based certifications to validate expertise for those in Cloud Practitioner, architect, developer, and operations roles, plus Specialty certifications to validate advanced skills in specific technical areas. Details of each certification may be accessed through the AWS Certification homepage.\n\nBeta exams\n\nAWS Certification follows a rigorous process to create industry-recognized exams and credentials. Beta periods for new exams and new exam versions allow for testing the performance and quality of each question before use in a live exam.\n\nPassing a beta exam earns candidates the applicable AWS Certification. Beta exams are offered at a 50% discount from standard exam pricing, and results are made available within 90 days of the end of the beta period. Learn more about beta exams on our Coming Soon page.\n\nExam Preparation\n\nThe best preparation for AWS Certification exams is practical experience. You can find specific recommendations to prepare for each certification exam by accessing our exam preparation page.\n\n\nAdditional AWS resources\n\nAWS offers many relevant options to supplement your learning:\n\nCustomized learning paths\nDigital and instructor-led training\n\nExam readiness courses\nWhitepapers\nFree tier access to AWS services\n\nBlogs\n\nPlease note that these offerings are neither required nor endorsed, and that we recommend you still review the exam content outline. Use the outline to determine what you will need to learn in preparation for the exam. You can find preparation resources for each certification on our exam preparation page.  \n\nAWS Certification Official Practice Question Sets\n\nAWS Certification Official Practice Question Sets feature sample questions developed by AWS to demonstrate the style and depth of our certification exams. You can experience these exam-style questions, which offers detailed feedback and recommended resources to help fill gaps. AWS Certification Official Practice Question Sets are available for free on AWS Skill Builder.\n\n\nSample questions\n\nWe post sample questions on our website to provide you with an opportunity to become familiar with the format of questions used on AWS Certification exams. Sample questions are used strictly for illustrative purposes and are not indicative of actual content on the exams.\n\nAccommodations Commitment\n\nAWS Certification and their vendors are committed to providing all individuals with an opportunity to validate technical skills and cloud expertise. We will provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities to help ensure equitable access to AWS Certification.\n\n\nRequesting Accommodations\n\nReasonable accommodations are granted for applicants with documented disabilities in coordination with our test delivery provider. Special accommodations will be arranged individually and in advance with the test delivery provider.\n\n\nAccommodations must be requested prior to scheduling each exam.\n\nEnglish as a second language\n\nA 30-minute exam extension is available upon request to non-native English speakers when taking an exam in English. The accommodation, “ESL +30,” only needs to be requested once, prior to registering for an exam. It will apply to all future exam registrations with all test delivery providers. To request this accommodation, follow these steps:\n\nSign in to aws.training/Certification. \nSelect the Go to your Account button. \nSelect the Request Exam Accommodations button, followed by Request Accommodation.\nUsing the Accommodation Type dropdown, select ESL +30 MINUTES.\nSelect the Create button.\nAccommodations at Pearson VUE\n\nFor Pearson VUE-granted accommodations, candidates will be required to request accommodations directly with Pearson VUE. A candidate with an approved accommodation will be given instructions for scheduling their exam appointment over the phone. For more information and to request accommodations, visit Pearson VUE’s accommodations page.\n\nComfort aids\n\nThere are specific comfort aids, such as medicines, medical devices, and other items, that do not require prior approval. You may bring these items to test centers. Allowable comfort aids differ based on the test delivery provider.\n\n\nVisit Pearson VUE’s comfort aids page for the current list of their allowed comfort aids.\n\n\nScheduling Exams\n\nTo schedule a certification exam, you must first create an AWS Certification Account. Your AWS Certification Account is a central management tool for AWS Certification, allowing you to schedule exams and take advantage of certification benefits.\n\n\nCreating an AWS Certification Account\n\nYour AWS Certification Account uses single sign-on (SSO) authentication from your aws.training account. If you have not yet created an aws.training account, go to aws.training, select the Sign In button at the top right, and create the appropriate account for yourself as a customer, APN Partner, or Amazon employee.\n\nOnce you are signed in to your account, select Certification from the top navigation. You will be prompted to fill out basic demographic information. As you enter your first name (given name) and last name (surname) when filling out this information, be sure they match your first and last name as they appear on the identification you will be required to present at your exam appointment. If the names are not identical, you will not be permitted to take the exam.

In cases of personal illness or unforeseen emergencies, and with appropriate documentation, the test delivery provider will waive the fee and allow the exam to be rescheduled without charging additional fees. To request an excused absence, contact Pearson VUE accordingly.\nCancellation policy\n\nYou must contact Pearson VUE (refer to the contact information above) or access your online account to cancel your exam a minimum of 24 hours prior to your appointment. Canceling your exam less than 24 hours prior to your appointment, or failing to appear for your appointment, will result in the forfeiture of your exam fee.\n\nIf you wish to reschedule your exam, sign in to your AWS Certification Account to complete the rescheduling process.\n\nCandidate information, sharing, access, and data privacy\n\nTo offer certifications, AWS needs to collect some personal information about you, but we will never sell your personal information to others. We share personal information only as described in the AWS Privacy Policy, and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to the AWS Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in the policy.\n\nThe AWS Training and Certification team complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by providing a way for European Union members to request the deletion of personal data and by providing candidates with their personal data with a description of how it is used. We will also systematically notify you if an account breach occurs. You can find more details in AWS Training and Certification’s GDPR compliance FAQ.  \n\nOther countries, out-of-country testing, and sanctioned/embargoed countries\n\nAWS Certification exams are not delivered in countries that are subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited: to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council; the United States Government; the European Union or its member states; or any other applicable government authority. Our test delivery providers are committed to complying with applicable laws in the countries in which we operate, including international sanctions that may restrict us from providing services in, or to residents of, certain countries. A list of countries where AWS exams are delivered may be found during exam scheduling for Pearson VUE test centers.\n\nTo sit for an AWS Certification exam, you must provide valid government-issued identification establishing residence in a non-sanctioned country. If you do not have a qualifying government-issued ID from the country you are testing in (except for candidates who will use a European Union ID), an international travel passport from your country of citizenship is required and must be presented as your primary form of ID. A secondary form of ID is still required.\n\nPayment methods\n\nYou can pay for AWS Certification exams using a credit card or voucher. The following credit cards can be used at Pearson VUE: Visa, American Express, Mastercard, and JCB.\n\nLearn more about AWS Certification exam vouchers on our voucher webpage.  \n\nTest delivery provider terms and conditions\n\nWhen scheduling an exam with Pearson VUE, you will be prompted to agree to the test delivery provider’s terms and conditions. Be sure to read these terms and conditions carefully before proceeding to schedule your exam.  \n\nLearn About AWS\nWhat Is AWS?\nWhat Is Cloud Computing?\nAWS Inclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWhat Is DevOps?\nWhat Is a Container?\nWhat Is a Data Lake?\nWhat is Generative AI?\nAWS Cloud Security\nWhat's New\nBlogs\nPress Releases\nResources for AWS\nGetting Started\nTraining and Certification\nAWS Solutions Library\nArchitecture Center\nProduct and Technical FAQs\nAnalyst Reports\nAWS Partners\nDevelopers on AWS\nDeveloper Center\nSDKs & Tools\n.NET on AWS\nPython on AWS\nJava on AWS\nPHP on AWS\nJavaScript on AWS\nHelp\nContact Us\nGet Expert Help\nFile a Support Ticket\nAWS re:Post\nKnowledge Center\nAWS Support Overview\nLegal\nAWS Careers\nCreate an AWS Account\nAmazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer: Minority / Women / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation / Age.\nLanguage عربي Bahasa Indonesia Deutsch English Español Français Italiano Português Tiếng Việt Türkçe Ρусский ไทย 日本語 한국어 中文 (简体) 中文 (繁體)\nPrivacy | Site Terms | Cookie Preferences | © 2024, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.
